## Installation

```bash

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secprog/dependency-track-mcp.git
cd dependency-track-mcp
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

### Security Warning ⚠️ - OAuth 2.1 Required

**This MCP server requires OAuth 2.1 bearer token authentication** as specified in the [MCP Authorization Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization).

All requests must include a valid OAuth 2.1 bearer token:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_oauth2_token>
```

Follow these security best practices:

- **Configure OAuth 2.1 issuer** - Set `MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER` to your OAuth provider
- **Never commit API keys** - Use environment variables or an environment file based on [.env.example](.env.example) (already ignored by [.gitignore](.gitignore))
- **Use HTTPS only** - Always connect to Dependency Track over HTTPS with valid certificates
- **Minimal scopes** - Request only the scopes your use case needs
- **Rotate credentials** - Change API keys and tokens periodically
- **Secure client configs** - Restrict file permissions on MCP client configuration files

📖 See [KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md](KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md) and [.env.example](.env.example) for OAuth 2.1 setup and configuration examples.

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# OAuth 2.1 Authorization (REQUIRED)
export MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com
export MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URL=https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json  # Optional (auto-derived if omitted)
export MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE=dependency-track-mcp  # Optional
export MCP_OAUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPES="read:projects read:vulnerabilities"  # Optional
export MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URI=https://your-mcp-host.example.com/mcp  # Optional

# Dependency Track Backend (for server-to-API auth only)
export DEPENDENCY_TRACK_URL=https://dependency-track.example.com
export DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY=your-dtrack-api-key

# Optional
export DEPENDENCY_TRACK_TIMEOUT=30
export DEPENDENCY_TRACK_VERIFY_SSL=true
export DEPENDENCY_TRACK_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Server Settings (HTTPS by default)
export MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
export MCP_SERVER_PORT=9000
export MCP_SERVER_TLS_CERT="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
export MCP_SERVER_TLS_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
export MCP_SERVER_TLS_CA_CERTS="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"  # Optional
export MCP_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE_PASSWORD=your_password  # Optional
```

Or create an environment file based on [.env.example](.env.example).

### OAuth 2.1 Setup

1. **Configure your OAuth provider** to support OpenID Connect with JWT tokens
2. **Publish JWKS endpoint** for token signature verification
3. **Set token claims** to include `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, and `scope` or `scopes`
4. **Use HTTPS** for all OAuth endpoints
5. **Set appropriate token lifetime** (e.g., 1 hour)

### Getting a Dependency Track API Key

The API key is used for **server-to-API authentication only** and is not exposed to MCP clients.

1. Log in to Dependency Track as an administrator
2. Navigate to Administration > Access Management > Teams
3. Select or create a team
4. Generate a new API key for the team
5. Copy the key (it won't be shown again)
6. Store it in `DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY` environment variable

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
# Using the installed entry point
dependency-track-mcp

# Or run directly
python -m dependency_track_mcp.main
```

This starts a FastAPI server with OAuth 2.1 JWT authentication and mounts the MCP endpoint at `/mcp`. If TLS certs are provided, it serves HTTPS. HTTP is only allowed when `MCP_DEV_ALLOW_HTTP=true`.

### HTTP Endpoints

- `/mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint (protected by OAuth 2.1 Bearer tokens)
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` - OAuth resource metadata (RFC 8707)
- `/health` - Health check

### Configuration for Production

Required environment variables (or an environment file based on [.env.example](.env.example)):

```bash
# OAuth 2.1 (required)
MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/mcp
MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE=mcp-api

# TLS certificates (required for HTTPS)
MCP_SERVER_TLS_CERT="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
MCP_SERVER_TLS_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

# Dependency Track backend
DEPENDENCY_TRACK_URL=https://dtrack.example.com
DEPENDENCY_TRACK_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Local Development

For local development with HTTP (never use in production):

```bash
# Enable HTTP for local testing
MCP_DEV_ALLOW_HTTP=true
MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=http://localhost:8083/realms/mcp
DEPENDENCY_TRACK_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

See [KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md](KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md) for setting up local Keycloak.

### Quick Start Script

If you prefer a simple launcher with environment-file validation, use [start_services.py](start_services.py).

### Client Configuration (HTTP transport)

Point your MCP client at the HTTP endpoint and include a Bearer token:

- MCP endpoint: `https://<host>:<port>/mcp` (use `http://` only when `MCP_DEV_ALLOW_HTTP=true`)
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <oauth2_token>`

**Security Notes**:
- The Dependency Track API key is stored server-side only (not exposed to clients)
- OAuth tokens are transmitted at runtime (not stored in config)
- TLS certificates can be provided as PEM content (use `\n` for newlines)
- Restrict file permissions on any client config that includes secrets
